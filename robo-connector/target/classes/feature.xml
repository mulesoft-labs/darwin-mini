non-exclusive license, subject to third party intellectual property claims:&#13;
&#13;
(a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)&#13;

and/or otherwise dispose of the Original Code (or portions thereof).&#13;
&#13;
(c) the licenses granted in this Section 2.1(a) and (b) are effective on the&#13;
date Initial Developer first distributes Original Code under the terms of this&#13;
License.&#13;
&#13;
(d) Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted: 1)&#13;
for code that You delete from the Original Code; 2) separate from the Original&#13;
Code; or 3) for infringements caused by: i) the modification of the Original&#13;
Code or ii) the combination of the Original Code with other software or&#13;
devices.&#13;

&#13;
(a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)&#13;

separate from the Contributor Version; 3) for infringements caused by: i) third&#13;
party modifications of Contributor Version or ii) the combination of&#13;
Modifications made by that Contributor with other software (except as part of&#13;
the Contributor Version) or other devices; or 4) under Patent Claims infringed&#13;
by Covered Code in the absence of Modifications made by that Contributor.&#13;
&#13;
3. Distribution Obligations.&#13;
&#13;
3.1 Application of License.&#13;
The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are governed by&#13;
the terms of this License, including without limitation Section 2.2. The Source&#13;
Code version of Covered Code may be distributed only under the terms of this&#13;
License or a future version of this License released under Section 6.1, and You&#13;
must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You&#13;
distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code version&#13;
that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the&#13;
recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include an additional document&#13;
offering the additional rights described in Section 3.5.&#13;
&#13;
3.2 Availability of Source Code.&#13;
Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be made&#13;
available in Source Code form under the terms of this License either on the same&#13;
media as an Executable version or via an accepted Electronic Distribution&#13;
Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an Executable version available; and if&#13;
made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for&#13;
at least twelve (12) months after the date it initially became available, or at&#13;
least six (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification&#13;
has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for ensuring&#13;
that the Source Code version remains available even if the Electronic&#13;
Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.&#13;
&#13;
3.3 Description of Modifications.&#13;
You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a file&#13;
documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and the date of any&#13;
change. You must include a prominent statement that the Modification is&#13;
derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Code provided by the Initial&#13;
Developer and including the name of the Initial Developer in (a) the Source&#13;
Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable version or related documentation in&#13;
which You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Code.&#13;
&#13;
3.4 Intellectual Property Matters&#13;
&#13;
(a) Third Party Claims.&#13;
If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's intellectual&#13;
property rights is required to exercise the rights granted by such Contributor&#13;
under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor must include a text file with the Source&#13;
Code distribution titled "LEGAL" which describes the claim and the party making&#13;
the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If&#13;
Contributor obtains such knowledge after the Modification is made available as&#13;
described in Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in&#13;
all copies Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps&#13;
(such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably&#13;
calculated to inform those who received the Covered Code that new knowledge has&#13;
been obtained.&#13;
&#13;
(b) Contributor APIs.&#13;
If Contributor's Modifications include an application programming interface and&#13;
Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which are reasonably necessary to&#13;
implement that API, Contributor must also include this information in the LEGAL&#13;
file.&#13;
&#13;
(c) Representations.&#13;
Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section 3.4(a)&#13;
above, Contributor believes that Contributor's Modifications are Contributor's&#13;
original creation(s) and/or Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the&#13;
rights conveyed by this License.&#13;
&#13;
3.5 Required Notices.&#13;
You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code. If&#13;
it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to&#13;
its structure, then You must include such notice in a location (such as a&#13;
relevant directory) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice. If&#13;
You created one or more Modification(s) You may add your name as a Contributor&#13;
to the notice described in Exhibit A. You must also duplicate this License in&#13;
any documentation for the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or&#13;
ownership rights relating to Covered Code. You may choose to offer, and to&#13;
charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one&#13;
or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own&#13;
behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must&#13;
make it absolutely clear than any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability&#13;
obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the&#13;
Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the&#13;
Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,&#13;
indemnity or liability terms You offer.&#13;
&#13;
3.6 Distribution of Executable Versions.&#13;
You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the requirements of&#13;
Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code, and if You include a notice&#13;
stating that the Source Code version of the Covered Code is available under the&#13;
terms of this License, including a description of how and where You have&#13;
fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously&#13;
included in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or&#13;
collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the Covered&#13;
Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered Code or ownership&#13;
rights under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from&#13;
this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License&#13;
and that the license for the Executable version does not attempt to limit or&#13;
alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code version from the rights set&#13;
forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable version under a&#13;
different license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ&#13;
from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer,&#13;
Original Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the&#13;
Initial Developer, Original Developer and every Contributor for any liability&#13;
incurred by the Initial Developer, Original Developer or such Contributor as a&#13;
result of any such terms You offer.&#13;
&#13;
3.7 Larger Works.&#13;
You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not&#13;
governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single&#13;
product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are&#13;
fulfilled for the Covered Code.&#13;
&#13;
4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.&#13;
If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with&#13;
respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute, judicial order, or&#13;
regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the&#13;
maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they&#13;
affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file described in&#13;
Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code.&#13;
Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must&#13;
be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to&#13;
understand it.&#13;
&#13;
5. Application of this License.&#13;
This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the&#13;
notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.&#13;
&#13;
6. Versions of the License.&#13;
&#13;
6.1 New Versions.&#13;
MuleSoft, Inc. ("MuleSoft") may publish revised and/or new versions of the&#13;
License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version&#13;
number.&#13;
&#13;
6.2 Effect of New Versions.&#13;
Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the License,&#13;
You may always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also&#13;
choose to use such Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version of the&#13;
License published by MuleSoft. No one other than MuleSoft has the right to&#13;
modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created under this License.&#13;
&#13;
6.3 Derivative Works.&#13;
If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may only do&#13;
in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code governed by this&#13;
License), You must (a) rename Your license so that the phrases "MuleSoft",&#13;
"CPAL" or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your license (except&#13;
to note that your license differs from this License) and (b) otherwise make it&#13;
clear that Your version of the license contains terms which differ from the&#13;
CPAL. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer, Original Developer,&#13;
Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A shall not of&#13;
themselves be deemed to be modifications of this License.)&#13;
&#13;
7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.&#13;
COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT&#13;
WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT&#13;
LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE,&#13;
FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE&#13;
QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE&#13;
PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ORIGINAL&#13;
DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING,&#13;
REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART&#13;
OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER&#13;
THIS DISCLAIMER.&#13;
&#13;
8. TERMINATION.&#13;
&#13;
8.1 This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically&#13;
if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30&#13;
days of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the Covered Code which&#13;
are properly granted shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions&#13;
which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this&#13;
License shall survive.&#13;
&#13;
8.2 If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim&#13;
(excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer, Original&#13;
Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer, Original Developer or&#13;
Contributor against whom You file such action is referred to as "Participant")&#13;
alleging that:&#13;
&#13;
(a) such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes&#13;
any patent, then any and all rights granted by such Participant to You under&#13;
Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from&#13;
Participant terminate prospectively, unless if within 60 days after receipt of&#13;
notice You either: (i) agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable&#13;
reasonable royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such&#13;
Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to the&#13;
Contributor Version against such Participant. If within 60 days of notice, a&#13;
reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in&#13;
writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights&#13;
granted by Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically&#13;
terminate at the expiration of the 60 day notice period specified above.&#13;
&#13;
(b) any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's&#13;
Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any&#13;
rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b) and 2.2(b) are&#13;
revoked effective as of the date You first made, used, sold, distributed, or had&#13;
made, Modifications made by that Participant.&#13;
&#13;
8.3 If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging that&#13;
such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any&#13;
patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to&#13;
the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of&#13;
the licenses granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be&#13;
taken into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or&#13;
license.&#13;
&#13;
8.4 In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, all end user&#13;
license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been&#13;
validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination shall&#13;
survive termination.&#13;
&#13;
9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.&#13;
UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING&#13;
NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ORIGINAL&#13;
DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, OR ANY&#13;
SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT,&#13;
SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING,&#13;
WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER&#13;
FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN&#13;
IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS&#13;
LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL&#13;
INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW&#13;
PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR&#13;
LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND&#13;
LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.&#13;
&#13;
10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.&#13;
The Covered Code is a "commercial item," as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R.&#13;
2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer software" and "commercial&#13;
computer software documentation," as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212&#13;
(Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through&#13;
227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with&#13;
only those rights set forth herein.&#13;
&#13;
11. MISCELLANEOUS.&#13;
This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof.&#13;
If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision&#13;
shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. This&#13;
License shall be governed by California law provisions (except to the extent&#13;
applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law&#13;
provisions. With respect to disputes in which at least one party is a citizen&#13;
of, or an entity chartered or registered to do business in the United States of&#13;
America, any litigation relating to this License shall be subject to the&#13;
jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern District of California, with&#13;
venue lying in Santa Clara County, California, with the losing party responsible&#13;
for costs, including without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys'&#13;
fees and expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts&#13;
for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or&#13;
regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed&#13;
against the drafter shall not apply to this License.&#13;
&#13;
12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.&#13;
As between Initial Developer, Original Developer and the Contributors, each&#13;
party is responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out&#13;
of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to work with&#13;
Initial Developer, Original Developer and Contributors to distribute such&#13;
responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or shall be&#13;
deemed to constitute any admission of liability.&#13;
&#13;
13. MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE.&#13;
Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as&#13;
Multiple-Licensed. Multiple-Licensed means that the Initial Developer permits&#13;
you to utilize portions of the Covered Code under Your choice of the CPAL or the&#13;
alternative licenses, if any, specified by the Initial Developer in the file&#13;
described in Exhibit A.&#13;
&#13;
14. ADDITIONAL TERM: ATTRIBUTION&#13;
&#13;
(a) As a modest attribution to the organizer of the development of the&#13;
Original Code ("Original Developer"), in the hope that its promotional value may&#13;
help justify the time, money and effort invested in writing the Original Code,&#13;
the Original Developer may include in Exhibit B ("Attribution Information") a&#13;
requirement that each time an Executable and Source Code or a Larger Work is&#13;
launched or initially run (which includes initiating a session), a prominent&#13;
display of the Original Developer's Attribution Information (as defined below)&#13;
must occur on the graphic user interface employed by the end user to access such&#13;
Covered Code (which may include display on a splash screen), if any. The size&#13;
of the graphic image should be consistent with the size of the other elements of&#13;
the Attribution Information. If the access by the end user to the Executable and&#13;
Source Code does not create a graphic user interface for access to the Covered&#13;
Code, this obligation shall not apply. If the Original Code displays such&#13;
Attribution Information in a particular form (such as in the form of a splash&#13;
screen, notice at login, an "about" display, or dedicated attribution area on&#13;
user interface screens), continued use of such form for that Attribution&#13;
Information is one way of meeting this requirement for notice.&#13;
&#13;
(b) Attribution information may only include a copyright notice, a brief&#13;
phrase, graphic image and a URL ("Attribution Information") and is subject to&#13;
the Attribution Limits as defined below. For these purposes, prominent shall&#13;
mean display for sufficient duration to give reasonable notice to the user of&#13;
the identity of the Original Developer and that if You include Attribution&#13;
Information or similar information for other parties, You must ensure that the&#13;
Attribution Information for the Original Developer shall be no less prominent&#13;
than such Attribution Information or similar information for the other party.&#13;
For greater certainty, the Original Developer may choose to specify in Exhibit B&#13;
below that the above attribution requirement only applies to an Executable and&#13;
Source Code resulting from the Original Code or any Modification, but not a&#13;
Larger Work. The intent is to provide for reasonably modest attribution,&#13;
therefore the Original Developer cannot require that You display, at any time,&#13;
more than the following information as Attribution Information: (a) a copyright&#13;
notice including the name of the Original Developer; (b) a word or one phrase&#13;
(not exceeding 10 words); (c) one graphic image provided by the Original&#13;
Developer; and (d) a URL (collectively, the "Attribution Limits").&#13;
&#13;
(c) If Exhibit B does not include any Attribution Information, then there&#13;
are no requirements for You to display any Attribution Information of the&#13;
Original Developer.&#13;
&#13;
(d) You acknowledge that all trademarks, service marks and/or trade names&#13;
contained within the Attribution Information distributed with the Covered Code&#13;
are the exclusive property of their owners and may only be used with the&#13;
permission of their owners, or under circumstances otherwise permitted by law or&#13;
as expressly set out in this License.&#13;
&#13;
15. ADDITIONAL TERM: NETWORK USE.&#13;
The term "External Deployment" means the use, distribution, or communication of&#13;
the Original Code or Modifications in any way such that the Original Code or&#13;
Modifications may be used by anyone other than You, whether those works are&#13;
distributed or communicated to those persons or made available as an application&#13;
intended for use over a network. As an express condition for the grants of&#13;
license hereunder, You must treat any External Deployment by You of the Original&#13;
Code or Modifications as a distribution under section 3.1 and make Source Code&#13;
available under Section 3.2.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
EXHIBIT A. Common Public Attribution License Version 1.0.&#13;
